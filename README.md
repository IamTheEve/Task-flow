# Task-flow
A simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 


This is a simple interactive to-do list using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 


The user can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the to-do list. Each task appears as a list item with a checkbox, the task text, and a "Delete" button. Clicking the checkbox marks the task as complete with a line-through style, and clicking the "Delete" button removes the task from the list.
